# QuickCh@
Quickch@ is a full stack, dockerized chat application for creating rooms and sending messages.

## Prerequisites
1. Users are authenticated via unique username (passwords not required).
2. Users can create public rooms with unique names, which are listed by most recently active.
3. Users can post messages to any room, specific to that room, and can see the last 50 messages.

## Working Solution
This application will be built utilizing the MERN stack, primarily with ESX syntax and without the use of many additional libraries.
The goal of this exercise will be to produce an MVP within a limited time-frame, and modify as time permits.
